 5. Best Practices for Strong Passwords:
 
      - Use at least 12-16 characters.
      - Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
      - Avoid personal info or dictionary words.
      - Use unique passwords per site.
      - Use a password manager.
 

 6. Tips Learned:

      - Avoid names, patterns, or common words.
      - Longer = stronger.
      - Mix symbols/numbers for complexity.
      - Use randomness.
      - Store securely with a password manager.
 
 
 7. Common Password Attacks:
    
   -Brute Force: Tries all combinations.
   -Dictionary Attack: Uses known password lists.
   -Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked credentials.
   -Phishing: Tricks users into revealing passwords.
 
 
 8. Summary:
     
    Password Complexity & Security:
    
      - Simple passwords are easily cracked.
      - Complexity increases resistance to attacks.
      - Random, long, and mixed-character passwords are most secure.
      - Password entropy is crucial.
